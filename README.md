# rgbds-live

A live RGBDS programming environment in the browser, allowing for realtime assembly programming for the Game Boy. Powered by webassembly builds of [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) and the [Binjgb](https://github.com/binji/binjgb) emulator.

## Build

System requirements:

- bison, cmake
- [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

Make sure you initialize submodules to be able to build the WebAssembly modules:

```bash
# Pull RGBDS-live, rgbds and binjgb sources
git clone https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds-live --recursive
# Do a full build
./build.sh
```

To start hacking, use the development server:
```bash
# Development server with live refresh:
npm run dev
```
